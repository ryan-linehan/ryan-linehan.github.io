After seeing multiple "closed" revival attempts of Tribal Trouble fail, I've been thinking about why open source matters for game preservation and community building.

## The Graveyard of Closed Revivals

Tribal Trouble has had at least three revival attempts before ours. Each one followed the same pattern:

1. Enthusiastic developer announces revival
2. Community gets excited
3. Progress is made behind closed doors
4. Developer loses interest or time
5. Project dies, taking all progress with it

This cycle is frustrating for everyone involved, especially the community members who invested hope and sometimes money.

## Why Open Source Changes Everything

When we decided to revive Tribal Trouble, we made one critical decision: **everything would be open source from day one**.

### Knowledge Persists

Even if I got hit by a bus tomorrow, the codebase would survive. Someone else could pick up where I left off. The reverse-engineering work, the bug fixes, the new features - none of it would be lost.

### Community Ownership

Open source transforms players from passive consumers into potential contributors. Some of our best features came from community pull requests:

- The improved water shader
- Controller support
- The Discord integration

### Trust Through Transparency

When your code is public, you can't hide anything. Players can see exactly what data you collect (none), how the multiplayer works, and what's coming in future updates.

## It's Not Always Easy

Open source isn't without challenges:

- **Code quality pressure** - Everyone can see your mistakes
- **Coordination overhead** - Managing contributors takes time
- **Slower initial progress** - Documentation and clean code slow you down at first

But the benefits far outweigh the costs, especially for game preservation projects.

## The Future

I hope more revival projects adopt open source principles. Games are cultural artifacts worth preserving, and open source is the best way to ensure they survive.
