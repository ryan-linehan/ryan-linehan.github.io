After seeing multiple "closed" revival attempts of Tribal Trouble fail, I've been thinking about why open source matters for game preservation and community building.

## The Graveyard of Closed Revivals

Tribal Trouble has had at least three revival attempts before ours. Each one followed the same pattern:

1. Enthusiastic developer announces revival
2. Community gets excited
3. Progress is made behind closed doors
4. Developer loses interest or time
5. Project dies, taking all progress with it

## Why Open Source Changes Everything

When we decided to revive Tribal Trouble, we made one critical decision: **everything would be open source from day one**.

### Knowledge Persists

Even if I got hit by a bus tomorrow, the codebase would survive. Someone else could pick up where I left off.

### Community Ownership

Open source transforms players from passive consumers into potential contributors.

### Trust Through Transparency

When your code is public, you can't hide anything. Players can see exactly what data you collect (none), how the multiplayer works, and what's coming in future updates.

## The Future

I hope more revival projects adopt open source principles. Games are cultural artifacts worth preserving, and open source is the best way to ensure they survive.
